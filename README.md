# Spritesheet_Py
My implementation of how to get a Sprite Sheet, based vaguely on pygame wiki's example. It requires that every sprite in the sheet is the same size and uses a json file to define them.

To use you just need to grab the spritesheet.py file and use that. It only has the function get_spritesheet and it just takes the path to the json file that defines you spritesheet.
